        <h2>Machine learning</h2>
        <p> is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. And it is obvious that machine learning depends heavily on mathematics and statistics. As it applies a lot of mathematical and statical theories using programming languages such as python (and using a lot of its generous libraries)</p>
        <p><b>Machine learning</b> has three types depending on the data structure fitted to the model and whether it is labelled or not</p>
        <ol start="i">
            <li><b>Supervised learning</b> (structured data and labelled).
            </li>
            <li><b>unupervised learning</b> (structured data and unlabelled).
            </li>
            <li><b>Reinforcement learning</b> (real time data).
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>As a simple example of structured labeled data, we can consider the following table which contains the prices of mobiles depending on some features:</p>
        <table border="1">

                    <th>mobile type
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </thead>

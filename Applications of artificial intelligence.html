        <p><b>APPLICATIONS OF Artificial intelligence</b>There are many applications of artificial intelligence, including those related to agriculture, education, health, education, health and electronic games

<li><b>Agriculture</b></li>
<p>In agriculture new AI advancements show improvements in gaining yield and to increase the research and development of growing crops. New artificial intelligence now predicts the time it takes for a crop like a tomato to be ripe and ready for picking thus increasing efficiency of farming.[3] These advances go on including Crop and Soil Monitoring, Agricultural Robots, and Predictive Analytics. Crop and soil monitoring uses new algorithms and data collected on the field to manage and track the health of crops making it easier and more sustainable for the farmers.[4]

    More specializations of AI in agriculture is one such as greenhouse automation, simulation, modeling, and optimization techniques.
    
    Due to the increase in population and the growth of demand for food in the future, there will need to be at least a 70% increase in yield from agriculture to sustain this new demand. More and more of the public perceives that the adaption of these new techniques and the use of Artificial intelligence will help reach that goal.</p>

    <li><b>Education</b></li>
    <p>AI tutors could allow for students to get extra, one-on-one help. They could also reduce anxiety and stress for some students, that may be caused by tutor labs or human tutors.[6] In future classrooms, ambient informatics can play a beneficial role. Ambient informatics is the idea that information is everywhere in the environment and that technologies automatically adjust to your personal preferences.[7] Study devices could be able to create lessons, problems, and games to tailor to the specific student's needs, and give immediate feedback.

        But AI can also create a disadvantageous environment with revenge effects, if technology is inhibiting society from moving forward and causing negative, unintended effects on society.[8] An example of a revenge effect is that the extended use of technology may hinder students’ ability to focus and stay on task instead of helping them learn and grow.[9] Also, AI has been known to lead to the loss of both human agency and simultaneity.</p>

        <li><b>Finance</b></li>
        <p>Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in banking can be traced back to 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank in the US set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards.[10] Programs like Kasisto and Moneystream are using AI in financial services.

            Banks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations, maintain book-keeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place.[11] In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition.[12] AI has also reduced fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies.[13][14][15]
            
            AI is increasingly being used by corporations. Jack Ma has controversially predicted that AI CEO's are 30 years away.[16][17]
            
            The use of AI machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories.[18] For example, AI-based buying and selling platforms have changed the law of supply and demand in that it is now possible to easily estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus individualized pricing. Furthermore, AI machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus making markets more efficient while reducing the volume of trades[citation needed]. Furthermore, AI in the markets limits the consequences of behavior in the markets again making markets more efficient.[19] Other theories where AI has had impact include in rational choice, rational expectations, game theory, Lewis turning point, portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking.[20] In August 2019, the AICPA introduced an AI training course for accounting professionals</p>

            <li><b>Government</b></li>
            <p>Artificial intelligence in government consists of applications and regulation. Artificial intelligence paired with facial recognition systems may be used for mass surveillance. This is already the case in some parts of China.[32][33] Artificial intelligence has also competed in the Tama City mayoral elections in 2018.

                In 2019, the tech city of Bengaluru in India is set to deploy AI managed traffic signal systems across the 387 traffic signals in the city. This system will involve use of cameras to ascertain traffic density and accordingly calculate the time needed to clear the traffic volume which will determine the signal duration for vehicular traffic across streets.</p>
